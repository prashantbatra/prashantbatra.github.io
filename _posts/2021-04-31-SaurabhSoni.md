“Prashant is a guy with high level of motivation and tendency to deliver the best. In fact, learning a new technology within less time is very easy for him and he motivates his own team to be flexible and be dedicated to deliver releases as the customer wanted. I appreciate his global understanding of project,which he had while his onsite tours at client sites. His team management skills are undoubtedly very good,because he shows a real good competence in managing guys of the same experience as he has,which i think is very difficult.Apart from professional life, he is very outgoing and has strong emotional quotient. He is an excellent blend of professional and personal life.”
